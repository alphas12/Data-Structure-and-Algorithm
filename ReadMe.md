## Pre-Midterm Topics

### 1. Abstract Data Type (ADT)

### 2. ADT List
- List vs ADT List comparison
- **List Operations:**
  - Initialize
  - Insert
  - Delete
  - Member
  - Locate
  - Other operations

#### Implementations of ADT List

1. **Array Implementation** (4 versions)
   - Version 1: List as structure with array and count
   - Version 2: List as pointer to structure
   - Version 3: List as structure with dynamic array
   - Version 4: List as pointer to structure with dynamic array

2. **Linked List Implementation** (Singly Link)

3. **Cursor-based Implementation**

Time Complexity: O(1), O(N), and O(NÂ²)

### 3. ADT Stack

#### Overview
- Stack concept and principles
- **Stack Operations:**
  - Top
  - Pop
  - Push
  - Utility functions (initStack, isEmpty, isFull)

#### Implementations
1. Array Implementation (4 versions)
2. Linked List Implementation
3. Cursor-based Implementation

Time Complexity: O(1) and O(N)

### 4. ADT Queue

#### Overview
- Queue concept and principles
- **Queue Operations:**
  - Front
  - Dequeue
  - Enqueue
  - Utility functions (initQueue, isEmpty, isFull)

#### Implementations
1. **Linked List Implementation**
   - Queue as pointer to dynamic node
   - Queue as structure with front/rear pointers

2. **Circular Array Implementation**
   - Solution 1: Counter-based
   - Solution 2: MAX-1 elements approach

Time Complexity: O(1) and O(N)

> **Note:** Stack and Queue cannot be traversed as per their definitions.
